## 🌿 What does this plugin do?

This QGIS plugin allows users to segment individual olive tree crowns from PNOA orthophotos and a parcel shapefile using a one-click workflow based on computer vision and Otsu’s method.

🎯 Use cases:
- Count olive trees in a parcel
- Estimate tree density or crown area
- Prepare spatial data for NDVI or health analysis per tree

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Automatic segmentation using Otsu thresholding
- ✅ Outputs a vector layer (polygons) where each feature is one tree
- ✅ Area of each crown is automatically calculated (in pixels)
- ✅ Minimal configuration, suitable for non-programmers
